# Note Groups!

## UX

### Project Goal
The goal of 'Note Groups!' is to create a website that hosts documents created by the user. The website will be broken into three template webpages: Home, Note, and Create Note. Home will display all created notes as postit notes, which when clicked on will take the user to that note. The note will be displayed on the Note page, and will be filled in with data from the database. Lastily, the link Create Note will lead the user to a page where they name and create a new note, which will automatically load the new note on creation.

#### Minimum viable product goals

The minumum viable product would have the home page list all Notes with no specified ordering and no styling, displaying the title the user gives the document. These Notes when clicked on will open a page containing text saved to the document id in the database. The Create Note link will successfully create a new note that will store content into the database and appear on the homepage.

#### Additional goals

Additional features I wish for the website are to be user complimentary features. A search bar at the top of the homepage to search through existing Notes, and when no results are found, instead offer a link to the Create Note page. Inside the Note page, the user will have the ability to add basic text effects to the documents, such as bold, italic and crossed-out text, as well as change font size, font colour, and font background/highlight, with these css stylings being saved to the database as well. The list of notes on the Homepage to be ordered by the last saved document. Add a way for the user to add multiple notes/text documents to a Note (to make a 'Note Group').
