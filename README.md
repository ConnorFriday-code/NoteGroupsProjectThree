# Note Groups!

## UX

### Project Goal
The goal of 'Note Groups!' is to create a website that hosts documents created by the user. The website will be broken into three template webpages: Home, Note, and Create Note. Home will display all created notes as postit notes, which when clicked on will take the user to that note. The note will be displayed on the Note page, and will be filled in with data from the database. Lastily, the link Create Note will lead the user to a page where they name and create a new note, which will automatically load the new note on creation.
